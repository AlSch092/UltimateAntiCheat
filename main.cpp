/*  
    U.A.C. is a non-invasive usermode anticheat for x64 Windows, tested on Windows 10 & 11. Usermode is used to ensure an optimal end user experience. It also provides insight into how many kernelmode attack methods can be prevented from usermode, through concepts such as secure boot enforcement and DSE checking.
